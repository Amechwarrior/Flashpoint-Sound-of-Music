# Flashpoint-Sound-of-Music
This is a BATTLETECH Flashpoint to play each music track for preview.  It advances through each of the 37 tracks found in audioeventdef_GroupConvos.json

This Flashpoint is not meant for normal play.  This is for Flashpoint authors to listen to tracks for selection in their custom Flashpoints.  Use this with a Debug Mode Career and do not leave this mod active during normal play.

###
DO NOT USE WITH A NORMAL SAVE.  Currently, adding a new FP will force that FP to always be present for the save file to load.

You should enable debug mode, start a new debug career and then travel to the planet Alloway.  In a debug save, all FPs will appear shortly after some travel.

Once you are done using this FP aid, exit the game and either disable the mod in the mod.json or remove the files from your mod folder before resuming normal play.
